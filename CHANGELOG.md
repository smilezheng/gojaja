# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is
loosely based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/);
this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

Tracking v2.0.0; see [docs/ROADMAP](./docs/ROADMAP.md) for PR sequencing.

### Planned next

- PR4: manifest `roleReminder` (so context-compressed agents re-anchor
  identity on every `plan`).

## [2.0.0-alpha.2] — 2026-05-27

### Added (PR3 — role / prompt / wait)

- `agentctl role create <id> [<title>] [--description] [--owns]
  [--reports-to] [--must-not-edit]` provisions a role end-to-end: it
  registers `<id>` in `.multi-agent/config.yaml` AND writes the human
  contract under `.multi-agent/roles/<id>.md`. Refuses duplicates.
- `agentctl role list` and `agentctl role show <id>`.
- `agentctl prompt <role> --target codex|claude|cursor|generic`
  prints an activation prompt. With `--write`, it also installs the
  host-specific persistent artifact:
  - `codex`: `${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}/skills/multi-agent-runtime/`
    SKILL.md + agents/openai.yaml.
  - `claude`: a marker-block `<!-- multi-agent-runtime:BEGIN..END -->`
    inside `<project>/CLAUDE.md`, preserving surrounding content.
  - `cursor`: `<project>/.cursor/rules/multi-agent-runtime.mdc` with
    `alwaysApply: true`.
  - `generic`: prints only.
  The persistent artifacts are role-agnostic (they teach the agent how
  to find its identity via `MA_SESSION`); a per-window activation
  snippet binds the role.
- `agentctl wait [--idle <min>] [--mode block|exit]` provides the
  cheap-keepalive primitive. `block` does a shell-level sleep, then
  one cursor-free check, exits 0 with `ATTENTION` or `IDLE`. `exit`
  writes a `.wait` sentinel and returns immediately. Never overloads
  exit codes; never mutates the cursor (closes v0.1 wait bugs).
- New Store methods: `createRole`, `readRoleFile`, `readConfig`,
  `writeConfig`, `writeWaitSentinel`.
- New on-disk artifact: `.multi-agent/config.yaml` (created by
  `agentctl init`). See [docs/SCHEMA.md → config.yaml](./docs/SCHEMA.md#configyaml).
- New on-disk artifact: `.multi-agent/comms/pending/<role>/.wait`
  sentinel (written by `agentctl wait --mode exit`).
- New dependency: `js-yaml` (plus `@types/js-yaml`) for config.yaml
  round-tripping.
- New `src/cli/prompts/` module: `core.ts` (shared body) + per-target
  wrappers (`codex.ts`, `claude.ts`, `cursor.ts`, `generic.ts`) + a
  small write engine that handles atomic replace and marker-block
  upsert with refuse-to-clobber-unrelated-files protection.
- 25 additional vitest cases (`tests/role.test.ts`,
  `tests/prompt.test.ts`, `tests/wait.test.ts`); 64/64 total.

### Changed

- `agentctl init` now also seeds `.multi-agent/config.yaml` with the
  current schemaVersion and an empty `roles` map.
- `agentctl help` reorganised around the three real audiences: things
  the user runs once (init / role / prompt), things the user runs once
  per window (claim / release), and things the agent runs on every turn
  (plan / ack / report / worklog / wait).
- ROADMAP re-sequenced. PR4 is now "manifest self-anchoring", PR5 is
  task board, PR6 is RFC, PR7 is ownership enforcement, PR8 is
  installer, PR9 is doctor/history/archival, PR10 is chaos/soak.

## [2.0.0-alpha.1] — 2026-05-27

### Added (PR2 — claim / plan / ack / report / worklog)

- `agentctl claim <role> [--ttl <s>] [--force]` leases a role for the
  current shell and prints the session id.
- `agentctl release [<role>]` ends the current session.
- `agentctl plan [<role>]` produces a JSON `Manifest` of unread events
  scoped to the role, persists it under
  `comms/pending/<role>/<ack-token>.json`, and stamps
  `cursor.pendingManifest`. Idempotent: calling twice in a row returns
  the same manifest with the same `ackToken`.
- `agentctl ack [<role>] --token <t>` advances the cursor exactly to
  the manifest's `advanceCursorTo`. Token mismatch is rejected;
  events that arrived between `plan` and `ack` are preserved unread.
- `agentctl report --to <role> --message <text> [--ref <id>]`
  publishes a REPORT event. `from` is derived from `MA_SESSION`; the
  agent cannot impersonate another role.
- `agentctl worklog --message <text>` broadcasts a WORKLOG event and
  also writes `worklog/<role>/<id>.md` for git-readable history.
- `MA_SESSION` environment variable carries identity between commands;
  `src/cli/identity.ts:resolveIdentity` enforces it.
- New `Store` methods: `findSessionById`, `publishReport`,
  `publishWorklog`, `openOrCreatePlan`, `ackManifest`.
- New types: `Manifest`, `ReportPayload`, `WorklogPayload`.
- 20 additional vitest cases (`tests/plan-ack.test.ts`,
  `tests/identity.test.ts`) — 39/39 total. Key regression tests:
  - `does NOT skip events that arrived after plan` — covers the
    v0.1 ack-race bug.
  - `is idempotent across retry` — covers crash-and-restart.
  - `never loses an event across a fast publish/plan/ack loop` —
    30-event property test.
  - `filters events by recipient, excludes self-sent` — sender does
    not re-process its own broadcasts.

### Changed

- Inbox is now a derived view (filter on the event stream by
  `to ∈ {role, "*"} && from !== role`). The `comms/inbox/<role>/`
  directory and the `Paths.inboxDir` constant are gone. See
  [docs/SCHEMA.md → Inbox is a derived view](./docs/SCHEMA.md#inbox-is-a-derived-view-not-files)
  for the rationale.

## [2.0.0-alpha.0] — 2026-05-27

### Added (PR1 — storage core)

- TypeScript-based `agentctl` CLI replacing the v0.1 bash prototype.
- `Store` interface (`src/core/store.ts`) shaped to allow a future HTTP
  transport without command-layer changes.
- `LocalFsStore` (`src/core/local-fs-store.ts`):
  - Atomic write-and-rename for all single-file mutations.
  - Immutable per-record event files in `comms/events/<ulid>.json`.
  - File-based per-resource lock with lease (default 30 s), PID
    liveness, and stale-break with `LOCK_BROKEN` audit event.
  - Cursor read/update under per-role lock; monotonic advancement
    enforced.
  - Session claim/release/heartbeat with `SESSION_CLAIMED`,
    `SESSION_RELEASED`, `SESSION_TAKEOVER` events.
- ULID id generation (monotonic process-local factory).
- Strict path validation: `resolveInside` rejects absolute paths and
  `..` escapes; role-id and lock-key whitelists.
- CLI commands: `agentctl --version`, `agentctl help`, `agentctl init`,
  `agentctl version`. All commands support `--json`.
- Stable error class → exit code map (see [DESIGN](./docs/DESIGN.md#errors-and-exit-codes)).
- Documentation set: `docs/DESIGN.md`, `docs/SCHEMA.md`,
  `docs/PROTOCOL.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, this changelog.
- Vitest test harness with 19 cases covering concurrent appends, cursor
  monotonicity, stale-lock takeover, session lifecycle, and path/role-id
  validation.

### Removed

- The entire v0.1 bash prototype: `templates/multi-agent/` (scripts,
  protocol markdown, role files, RFC templates), `skills/`, the
  `.multi-agent → templates/multi-agent` symlink, and the
  `bin/multi-agent.js` installer.
- The AGENTS.md "multi-agent-bridge" block (replaced by repo-level dev
  notes; the new bridge is reintroduced as part of PR6's installer).

### Notes

- This release is an alpha. The wire protocol between CLI and agent is
  still in flux; do not depend on it from production tooling.
- v0.1 is not supported. No migration path is provided. Anyone who used
  v0.1 should start fresh with `agentctl init`.
